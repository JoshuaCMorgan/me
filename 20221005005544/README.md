# Focus VS Blur: When to Use Focus and Blur Events in JavaScript
(link to website missing)
In JavaScript, the focus and blur events are opposite to each other. The focus event occurs when you click on an input field and the field gets focused.

The blur event occurs when you click away from an input field and the field loses focus.

You can use the focus event if you need to run some logic whenever someone clicks on the input field.
You will use the blur event if you need to run some logic when the user leaves the input field by clicking away.
