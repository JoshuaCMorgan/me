# Setup/Run a local Node server
- you can download node if not already downloaded
  - `brew install node'
  - or from (site)[https://nodejs.org/en/] 
- You can run the server with the command `npm start` to see your site. 
- The server will now be running on port `3000`, meaning you will be able to access the server at `http://localhost:3000`. 
- To stop the server, press `Ctrl-c`.

Once node is installed, you can install the packages and start the app by typing the following commands from the root of the app's directory:

1. Install packages: `npm install` in the root project directory
2. Run: `npm start`

As soon as you run `npm start`, open a new terminal.
